| One of the most frequently used methods for analyzing data is to track a trend over time. Some of the best visualizations for showing trends over time are line charts, area charts, and bar charts. | Another method for analyzing data is comparison and ranking. We compare and rank countries, regions, business segments, salesmen and sports players based on one or a set of criteria. In many cases, this shows us how we are doing. | Relationship charts are suited to showing how one variable relates to one or numerous different variables. You could use this to show how something positively effects, has no effect, or negatively effects another variable. Running a simple correlation is a great place to start in identifying relationships between measures. | Distribution analysis is extremely useful in data analysis because it shows how your quantitative values are distributed across their full quantitative range. Distribution charts help you to understand outliers, the normal tendency, and the range of information in your values. | There are occasions when you want to do a part-to-whole analysis. Although pie Charts are commonly used in this type of situation, we suggest you use them with displaying the values next to them as they are very hard to visualize by human eyes if the values are very close to each other. |
