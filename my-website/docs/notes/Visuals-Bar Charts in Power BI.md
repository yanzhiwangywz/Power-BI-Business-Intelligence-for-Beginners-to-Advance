Bar charts are one of the most common data visualizations. With them, you can quickly highlight differences between categories, clearly show trends and outliers, and reveal historic highs and lows at a glance. Bar charts are especially effective when you have data that can be split into multiple categories.

**Tips:**

* Use a bar chart to show the values of several items at a single point in time
* The horizontal format makes it easier to compare the values than a column chart
* Bar charts are good when you have a long series of labels
* Include multiple bar charts and group them next to one another on your dashboard. This helps the viewer quickly compare related information instead of flipping through a bunch of spreadsheets or slides to answer a question.
