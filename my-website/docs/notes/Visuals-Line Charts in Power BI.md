<p>This simple graph shows data over intervals with connected points.</p> 
<p>A line chart or line graph is a type of chart which displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line segments.[1] It is a basic type of chart common in many fields. It is similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments. A line chart is often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time – a time series – thus the line is often drawn chronologically.</p>

**Tips:**

* keep it simple.
* Don’t use a legend; directly label the series, instead.
* Emphasize what is important.
* Include zero baseline if possible.
* Label lines if possible. 
* Use the right height. 
* You don’t have to start the Y-axis scale at zero; break the scale if you  need.
* If you are comparing two time series with very different units of measurement, consider using a logarithmic scale.
